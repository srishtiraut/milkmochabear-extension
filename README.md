# 💛 Milkmochabear Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that displays a random adorable Milkmochabear image every time you click the **Refresh** button. Designed to brighten your day with cozy bear vibes! 🐻☀️

## Features

- Works entirely offline using locally stored images
- Smooth fade-out/fade-in transition between posts
- Cheerful yellow-themed UI
- Rounded card-style layout for a clean, polished look

---

## 📸 How It Works

The extension randomly selects one image from a predefined list in popup.js.

All images are stored locally in the images/ folder.

Clicking the Refresh button triggers the fade-out/fade-in effect to switch to a new image.
